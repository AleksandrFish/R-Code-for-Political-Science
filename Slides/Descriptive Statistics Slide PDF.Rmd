## Measurement

* Social science is about developing and testing causal theories:
  + Does minimum wage change levels of employment?
  + Does outgroup contact influence views on immigration?
* Theories are made up of concepts:
  + Minimum wage, level of employment, outgroup contact, views on
immigration.
  + We took these for granted when talking about causality.
* Important to consider how we measure these concepts.
  + Some more straightforward: what is your age?
  + Others more complicated: what does it mean to “be liberal”?
  + Have to create an operational definition of a concept to make it into a
variable in our dataset.
