## Introduction to Causal Inference

```


## Causal Questions

- Does the minimum wage increase the unemployment rate?
  - Unemployment rate went up aǒter the minimum wage increased
  - Would the unemployment rate have gone up, had the minimum wage increase not occurred?
- Does race affect one’s job prospect?
  - Jamal applied for a job but did not get it
  - Would Jamal have gotten a job if he were white?


## Logic of Causality

- Our intuition about causation relies too heavily on simple comparisons of
pre-post change in outcomes before and after something happens
  - No change: no causation
  - Increase in outcome: positive effect
  - Decrease in outcome: negative effect

- Comparison between factual and counterfactual
- **Fundamental problem of causal inference**: We must infer counterfactual
outcomes
- No causation without manipulation: **immutable characteristics**


## How do we draw causal inference?

- Anecdotes
- Correlations
- Regressions

These methods are all severely prone to error. Causal inference is a
hard problem and invalid causal reasoning is one of the most common
errors in human judgment, news reporting, and scientific studies!

## Anecdotes

- “My grandpa Boris ate two cloves of garlic everyday and lived until he
was 95 years old.”

- For every anecdote you know, there might be many that you do
not know that show the opposite pattern

- We often only raise those anecdotes that we like to see to justify
actions or behaviors

- All that the anecdotes suggests is that Boris was prone to have a
long life

- The key question for causal inference is about the unobserved
counterfactual: how long would Boris have lived had she never
ate garlic?

knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/afisher/Documents/R Code/R-Code-for-Political-Science/Slides/Images For Slides/win.png")
```


- The problem with correlations for causal inference is that they
often arise for reasons that have nothing to with the causal
process under investigation (spurious correlation)

- Correlations are often driven by _selection effects_:

  - People who drink one glass of wine may already have exisiting health issues (Hence they're not binge drinking...)

  - Basketball players are tall, but does playing basketball make you
taller?


## Correlations

- Correlations are often driven by _confounding factors_: 
  - ice cream sales are correlated with murder rates throughout a typical year.
  - Does not mean ice cream causes murders. Confounding factor:weather.

- Correlations are neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for
causality.


## Regressions

- Regressions are simply refined correlations that try to control for
other confounding factors. 

- Problems:
  - The list of all potential confounding factors is a bottomless pit.
  - How to properly control for confounders is often up for debate /
unknown

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/afisher/Documents/R Code/R-Code-for-Political-Science/Slides/Images For Slides/obesity.png")
```

## Regressions

- People whose friends tend to be obese might differ in many ways
from those whose friends are not obese:
  
  - They might be poorer economically, live in areas with easier access
to healthier food, have less access to sports, different hobbies,
eating habits, etc.

- For causal inference we need to ask: among people who are
identical in all respects, does making friends with obese persons
really make them more likely to become obese?

## Changing hearts and minds

- Question: can we effectively persuade people to change their minds?

- Hugely important question for media companies, political campaigns, companies, NGOs, etc.

- Psychological studies show it isn’t easy.

## Changing minds on gay marriage

- **Contact Hypothesis**: outgroup hostility diminished when people from
different groups interact with one another.

- We’ll explore this question the context of support for gay marriage
and contact with a member of the LGBT community.

  - $Y_i$ = support for gay marriage (1) or not (0)

  - $T_i$ = contact with member of LGBT community (1) or not (0)

## Causal effects & counterfactuals

- What does $T_i$ causes $Y_i$ mean ~ **counterfactuals** "what if"
- Would citizen $i$ have supported gay marriage if they had been exposed to
the LGBT community?

- _Two potential outcomes_:
  - $Y_i$(1) would $i$ have supported gay marriage if they had contact with a
member of the LGBT community?
  - $Y_i$(0) would $i$  have supported gay marriage if they didn’t have contact with a member of the LGBT community?

- **Causal effect**: $Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)$
-  **Fundamental problem of causal inference**: only one of the two potential
outcomes is observable.


## Quantity of interest

- We want to estimate the average causal effects over all units: **Sample Average Treament Effect (SATE)** 

$$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n {Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)}$$

- What we can estimate instead: **Difference in Means** 

$$\bar{Y}_{treated} - \bar{Y}_{control}$$

- $\bar{Y}_{treated}$: observed average outcome for treated group
- $\bar{Y}_{control}$: observed average outcome for control group
- How do we ensure that the **difference-in-means** is a good estimate of the
SATE?

## Randomized Control Trials

- Randomize!
- Key idea: **Randomization** of the treatment makes the treatment and control
groups “identical” on average.
- The two groups are similar in terms of all characteristics (both observed
and unobserved).
  - Control group is similar to treatment group
  - Outcome in control group ~ what would have happened to treatment
group if they had control.


## Potential problems with RCTs

- **Placebo effects:**
  - Respondents will be affected by any intervention, even if they shouldn’t have
any effect.

- **Hawthorne effects:**
  - Respondents act differently just knowing that they are under study

## Balance Checking

-  Can we determine if randomization “worked”?
-  If it did, we shouldn’t see large differences between treatment and control
group on **pretreatment variable**.
  - Pretreatment variable are those that are unaffected by treatment.
- We can check in the actual data for some pretreatment variable $X$
  -  $X_{treated}$ average value of variable for treated group.
  -  $X_{control}$ average value of variable for control group.
  - Under randomization $X_{treated}-X_{control} \approx 0$

## Multiple Treatments

- Instead of 1 treatment, we might have multiple **treatment arms**:
  - Control condition
  - Treatment A
  - Treatment B
  - Treatment C, etc

- In this case, we will look at multiple comparisons:
  - $\bar{Y}_{treated, A} - \bar{Y}_{control}$
  - $\bar{Y}_{treated, B} - \bar{Y}_{control}$
  - $\bar{Y}_{treated, A} - \bar{Y}_{treated, B}$

## Gay Marriage Example

- Question: can we effectively persuade people to change their minds?
- Two randomized control trials in Los Angeles (2013)
- Timed around the Supreme Court decision to legalize gay marriage in CA
- LaCour & Green (2015). “When contact changes minds: An experiment of
transmission of support for gay equality.” _Science_.

## Study Design

- Randomized treatment:
  - gay (n = 22) vs. straight (n = 19) canvassers with similar characteristics
  - same-sex marriage vs. recycling scripts (20 min conversation)
  - a total of 4 treatments: 2 × 2 factorial design
  - control group: no canvassing.

## Study Design

- Persuasion scripts are the same except one important difference:
  - gay canvassers: they would like to get married but the law prohibits it.
  - straight canvassers: their gay child, friend, or relative would like to get
married but the law prohibits it.

- What is the recycling script for? ~ **Placebo effect**
- Outcome measured via unrelated **panel** survey: self-reported support for
same-sex marriage.
- Why use an “unrelated” survey? ~ **Hawthorne effect**

  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.title = element_blank(), 
        legend.text = element_text(size = 9),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Observational Studies

- Example of an **observational study:**
  - We as researchers observe a naturally assigned treatment
  - Very common: oǒten can’t randomize for ethical/logistical reasons.
- **Internal validity:** are the causal assumption satisfied? Can we interpret this
as a causal effect?
  - RCTs usually have higher internal validity.
  - Observational studies less so, because pre-treatment variable may differ
between treatment and control groups
- **External validity:** can the conclusions/estimated effects be generalized
beyond this study?
  - RCTs weaker here because oǒten very expensive to conduct on representative
samples.
  - Observational studies oǒten have larger/more representative samples that
improve external validity

## Confounding

- **Confounder:** a pre-treatment variable affecting treatment and the outcome.
  - Example:
- **Confounding bias** in the estimated SATE due to these differences
  - $Y_{control}$  not a good proxy for $Y_{i}(0)$ in treated group.
  - one type: **selection bias** from self-selection into treatment


## Statistical Control

- **Statistical control:** adjust for confounders using statistical procedures.
  - can help to reduce confounding bias.
  
- One type of statistical control: **subclassification**
  - Compare treated and control groups within levels of a confounding variable.
  - Remaining effect can’t be due to the confounder
  
- **Threat to inference:** we can only control for observed variables ~ threat of
unmeasured confounding

## Difference in difference (DID)

- Key idea: use the before-and-after difference of **control group** to infer what would have happend to **treatment group** without treatment.
- **Parallel time trend assumption**
  - Example:
  - Threat to inference: non-parallel trends
